- Find should have a default action on Enter (and likewise Find and Replace).

- When "Find" does not find anything, it should ask whether it should look
  from the beginning, and if it does not find anything (or if the user
  cancels) _not_ jump at all.

- Enable to set breakpoints via the Breakpoints menu and F9 (IIRC).

- if there are images on which the plugin wants to work, they have to be
  transported to the other virtual machine.  Mark them with the "(Debugging)"
  suffix, like the main window.

- when debugging finished, give the user a chance to save resulting images
  or some such before closing the debuggee.

- Integrate Fiji Build much better.

- Identify unused imports (and add an option to remove them).

- Identify non-explicit imports and add an option to make them explicit.
