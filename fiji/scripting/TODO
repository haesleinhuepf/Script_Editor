- If I save a file with Ctrl-S (maybe the issue is not really the
  Ctrl-S), the '*' indicating that the file is unsaved does not go away.

- When I save the file to plugins/ and want to run the file, the
  _complete_ absolute path is converted to a class name, in this case it
  looks like this (which is wrong):

        .home.schindel.fiji.plugins.New_Plugin

  Of course, it should be

        New_Plugin

- There has to be a way to run the scripts without saving them (for
  Java, this probably means to save to a temporary directory, compile,
  and using the FijiClassLoader to load and execute the class, so that
  the current PluginClassLoader is unaffected.

- Debugging really must be grayed out if the language does not support
  it (or if tools.jar was not found, see my recent commit to that
  extent).

- if there are images on which the plugin wants to work, they have to be
  transported to the other virtual machine.  Mark them with the "(Debugging)"
  suffix, like the main window.

- Enable to set breakpoints via the Breakpoints menu and F9 (IIRC).

- when debugging finished, give the user a chance to save resulting images
  or some such before closing the debuggee.

- when called with

	fiji -eval 'run("Script Editor", "open=<relative path>");'

  it does not work; further, it opens _two_ editor windows.

- make Ctrl-R another shortcut for running, because people might be used to that
  by ImageJ's macro editor (and likewise F5 for the Visual Studio fans).

- finally(!) check the source rather than the menu label when determining which
  action to take.

- make the whole new document/switch documents/save document stuff sane, i.e.
  refactor it into functions (so that the '*' simply _cannot_ be forgotten).

- saveChangeDialog() is kinda pointless.  It's not enough to just ask.

- remove all those System.stderr/stdout messages.

- Integrate Fiji Build much better.
