Show stoppers (this needs to be done _before_ the first public release):

- Enable to set breakpoints via the Breakpoints menu and F9 (IIRC).

- when called with

	fiji -eval 'run("Script Editor", "open=<relative path>");'

  and the given file does not exist, it opens _two_ editor windows.

- make Ctrl-R another shortcut for running, because people might be used to that
  by ImageJ's macro editor (and likewise F5 for the Visual Studio fans).

Not-quite show-stoppers:

- if there are images on which the plugin wants to work, they have to be
  transported to the other virtual machine.  Mark them with the "(Debugging)"
  suffix, like the main window.

- when debugging finished, give the user a chance to save resulting images
  or some such before closing the debuggee.

Nice-to-haves:

- Integrate Fiji Build much better.

- Identify unused imports (and add an option to remove them).

- Identify non-explicit imports and add an option to make them explicit.
